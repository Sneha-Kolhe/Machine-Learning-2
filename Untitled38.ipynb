    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations that are present in the training data but do not represent the underlying patterns of the data.\n",
    "Consequences: The model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data, leading to poor performance on new or test data.\n",
    "Mitigation techniques:\n",
    "Cross-validation: Split the dataset into multiple subsets for training and validation. This helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "Regularization: Introduce penalties on model complexity to prevent it from fitting the noise in the data too closely. Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization are commonly used.\n",
    "Feature selection/reduction: Reduce the number of input features to focus on the most relevant ones and reduce the model's complexity.\n",

    "Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns or structure of the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test datasets. In other words, the model fails to learn the inherent relationships between the features and the target variable due to its simplicity.\n",

    "Scenarios where underfitting can occur in machine learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear models on nonlinear data: Linear regression or logistic regression models may underfit when the relationship between the features and the target variable is nonlinear. Such models cannot capture the nonlinear patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insufficient model complexity: When the chosen model is too simple to represent the underlying complexity of the data, underfitting can occur. For instance, using a linear regression model to predict a quadratic relationship between variables may lead to underfitting.\n",

    "Small training dataset: If the training dataset is small and does not contain enough diverse examples to represent the underlying distribution of the data, the model may not be able to learn the true relationship between the features and the target variable.\n",

    "High bias models: Models with high bias, such as decision trees with limited depth or neural networks with too few hidden units, may underfit the data. These models lack the capacity to capture the complexity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over-regularization: Applying excessive regularization techniques, such as strong L1 or L2 penalties, can lead to underfitting by overly constraining the model's flexibility. This prevents the model from fitting the training data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring relevant features: If important features are omitted from the model, it may fail to capture essential aspects of the data, resulting in underfitting. Feature selection methods that remove relevant features can lead to underfitting.\n",

    "Ignoring interactions between features: Some models assume that features are independent of each other, which may not be true in real-world scenarios. If interactions between features are ignored, the model may underfit the data."
